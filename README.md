#Udacity EU Scholarship - Development for Beginners - Quiz App

**Project Overview**
The Quiz App project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the course. You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app. You can share your app with family and friends, as well as with other students in this course.

The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. It’s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (We recommend about 5-10 quiz questions for a reasonable scope of your app).

**Why this project?**
At this point, we believe that you’re now ready to create your own app. You will have full ownership over the creative vision, planning, and development of the app. From what we’ve seen in the discussion forums, you each have a wealth of different experiences and unique areas of expertise. We would like to see that shine through in the app that you create.

**What will I learn?**
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

 - Planning your app design before coding.
- Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
- Creating, positioning, and styling views.
- Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
- Commenting and documenting your code.
